<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Matthew Thomas, I am 37 years old and I reside 
   in a little town in South Africa called Springs.  I like reading
   books, watching movies, Netflix, Sports and I am learning to love coding too.</p>

</li>  
<li>Ability to identify the shortest and most efficient route or sequence of actions in order to achieve goals and objectives.</li>
<li>Persistence and perseverance especially when faced with harsh objection</li>
<li>Thorough, precise and proud of whatever task is at hand no matter the magnitude/importance.</li>

<h4>My Weaknesses:</h4>
<ul>
<li>I need to work on exercising more patience when it comes to interacting with people that achieve their end results in a different way than I do.</li>
<li>An opportunity for development is to learn how to have a good work and home life balance because balance ensures success in both areas.</li>
<li>Another area for development is to seek the input and guidance of others in order to expedite decision making.</li>
</ul>
